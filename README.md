#### "Yearly Increase in Diabetes Cases: A Growing Health Concern"
This graph illustrates the steady rise in global diabetes prevalence over the years, highlighting an alarming trend. Factors such as lifestyle changes, urbanization, and aging populations have contributed to this exponential increase. The data underscores the need for urgent preventive measures and better healthcare strategies to combat the diabetes epidemic.

### Problem Statement:

##### -> Challenges in Manual Testing: 

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among diabetic patients, requiring timely and accurate detection for effective treatment. However, the current diagnosis largely depends on manual examination of retinal images by ophthalmologists. This process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject to human error and variability in interpretation. Additionally, there is a significant shortage of eye care specialists, especially in remote and underserved areas, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

##### -> Need for an Automated, Accurate Solution: 

Given the limitations of manual testing, there is an urgent need for an automated, reliable, and efficient solution to detect diabetic retinopathy. A deep learning-based model can offer high accuracy and consistency in identifying DR from retinal images, reducing the burden on healthcare professionals and increasing access to early diagnosis and intervention. Such a solution would improve patient outcomes, prevent vision loss, and enhance the overall efficiency of healthcare systems.
